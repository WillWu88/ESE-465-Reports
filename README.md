# FPGA Project Reports

This repo hosts three FPGA design projects, completed by me during ESE-465: Digital System Laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis.

All design, implementation, and testing were done using Xilinx Vivado and a Microblaze microprocessor running on a Digilent Nexys 4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA board.

Please refer to specific reports in the _Doc_ folder for more information.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions or comments. Thanks!
